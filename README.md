# Find Me Vegan Food

### Concept
Finding vegan food in Austin is a toss-up. Some of the reviews you find just aren't up-to-date or when you search the word "vegan", you may just find that those restaurants specifically DON'T have vegan options.
My app is meant to make it easy to find certain vegan dishes with a simple search. Say you're hankering for some "Mac n' cheese", well with my app, you can search user reviews and find the best and the right restaurants around town for that dish!

### How to Use
A user will use a search bar to input a dish they're looking to find in Austin. They will be propmpted with other user's reviews of this item and with that information, they can make an informed decision about where to eat. They can then use the map provided to find the location and other menu items offered at that restaurant.
